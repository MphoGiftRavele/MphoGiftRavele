## About the Project/ Business Understanding
The purpose of this project is to analyze and identify strategies that South Africa can implement to strengthen its currency, the South African rand (ZAR), and potentially reach its previous peak values against major currencies. 
The project also aims to determine the specific year in which the rand achieved its highest value based on historical performance. 
Understanding these aspects can help in formulating effective economic policies, improving investor confidence, and enhancing the overall economic stability of the country.

## Data Understanding
# Data sources
- Historical Exchange Rates: Data from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and international financial databases.

- Political Stability Indicators: Data from governance indices and reports on political stability and corruption.
- Commodity Prices: Historical prices of commodities such as gold and platinum, crucial to South Africa's economy.
#Future Enhancements
- Inclusion of real-time data analysis for up-to-date insights.
- Expansion of data sources to include more diverse economic indicators and qualitative factors.
